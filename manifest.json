			"UI_CONTRACT_ESPRESSO_DESC": "Hello, 47. Today, you will be heading back to Haven Island for another mission. Your target is Yosef Lindbergh, a former Stasi agent who defected to the CIA and was secretly leaking data directly from Berlin to Washington. From the 1980s, he worked for the main secret federal agency of East Germany, the Stasi, but he also had a secret deal with the CIA, leaking communist government secrets to the USA. At the same time, he participated in the terrifying acts of the German militia, including torture, repression and mass murder. After the collapse of the communist regime in Germany, he fled to America, where he worked for the CIA and took part in secret operations in Kuwait, Yugoslavia, Haiti and elsewhere. He worked undercover for the American government until some data was leaked. Yosef regularly abused his authority, committing acts of unnecessary and unauthorised violence and using U.S. government secrets for his own benefit. He soon disappeared, but our client, a German radio agency, which Yosef has some compromising data about, and is afraid that their secrets could be leaked, saw an opportunity in his escape. We must hurry, as the target is currently undergoing a 'vanishing' procedure on Haven Island and will soon disappear again, possibly forever.\nGood luck, 47. I will leave you to prepare",

			"bio_actor_yosef_lindberch": "Yosef Lindberg was born on March 18, 1959, in a small town of five thousand people called Burg-Stàrrgard, in Mecklenburg, GDR. His father was an ethnic Jew, who although had a German surname (like many Jews living in Germany) worked in the city administration, and his mother, a German, was a housewife.\n\nDespite Yosef's respect for his father, they quarreled regularly for political reasons - the father was an orthodox socialist; he believed in the idea of collective property and communist ideals, and the young man had been drawn to the West since childhood - he was attracted to democratic values and American culture. During one of these quarrels, Yosef had to leave home - or rather, he was kicked out by his own father.\nHowever, despite his parents' expectations, the boy did not try to return - he earned enough money to hitchhike to Berlin and settle down in a local hotel.\n\nSoon he began to regularly attend meetings of the local enemies of the communist regime - the local Youth Democratic League, a youth organization that clandestinely united minds equally eager for freedom in their homeland. For several years, he studied English hard, and also went to the shooting range, learning to shoot and learning the basics of finance while moonlighting as a mechanic. After a few years, when he was in his early 20s, he decided to take a risk - to apply to the Stasi - and he was accepted. Now he was an agent of the GDR secret police, the hound dog of the communist regime.\n\nAfter working this way for a few months, he used his authority to secretly contact the CIA, making a deal and becoming a double agent. From that point on, he passed all the data he could find out about the East German government straight to hostile Washington. In an attempt to move up the ranks at the Stasi, to become a more respected employee, and to get more opportunities to snitch to the Americans, he turned in everyone he knew - even the very Youth Democratic League with which he had started. The poor people were arrested, and most likely repressed. In any case, no one ever saw them after their arrest.\n\nOver the next 10 years, Yosef became a very important Stasi operative - and practically the main CIA cell inside the GDR - but this career path did not come easily; Lindberg had to go over skulls. Dozens of murdered and repressed civilians and freedom fighters, hours of torture and kilograms of files with dirt on innocent people - that's what the \"model agent\" went through. However, in an instant everything collapsed. October 3, 1990 marked a new era in Yosef's life, as well as in the lives of millions of other Germans. The end of the communist regime in Germany. Lindberg was able to find a way out of the situation, and did not lose his job - he fled to the United States to work directly for Uncle Sam, carrying out the orders of the United States government.\n\nHe spent more than 20 years from assignment to assignment, being on the battlefields of all major U.S. military conflicts of the time, operating behind enemy lines - he was a saboteur in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, pretending to be a UN journalist, playing an important role in helping U.S. liberation forces uncover enemy positions in the Persian Gulf, participating in Operation \"Democracy Uphold\", which was an intervention in Haiti to overthrow a dictatorship, coordinated U.S. bombings during Operation \"Allied Force\" in Yugoslavia, helped the CIA support local anti-government revolutionary militias during the wars in Pakistan, Iraq and Afghanistan, and after the failed Afghan invasion fleed undercover to Syria, later satying there to work in a mission, which consisted of disrupting ISIS, al-Qaeda and al-Nusra Front, and in 2015 was transferred to Libya and spent months overseeing the operation against local Islamist militias with help of General Reza Zaydan's Marrokan regiment, until frightening details emerged - During the time he worked for the U.S. and participated in various military conflicts he violated hundreds of international laws - he killed hostages and unarmed people, used his official position for his own good, disclosed state secrets and even abused prisoners of war and refugees in every possible way.\n\nAfter the disclosure of such compromising information, the CIA could not help but react - he was soon put on an international wanted list on charges including the disclosure of state secrets, various war crimes and abuse. \nYosef was able to react quickly and went on the run, starting to sell all information he knew - this is what has ruined his plan. Our employer, one of Berlin's largest and most influential radio agencies, is in danger - because Yosef has a lot of compromising data on them; it turns out that the agency was selling information about its listeners to the Stasi and, in fact, conducting illegal surveillance of them, which eventually led to thousands of arrests and repressions. This information must never be released to the public - and we will take care of it. \n\nAccording to our sources, after nearly a decade on the run, Lindbergh recently arrived on Harbor Island, where he is now staying as a VIP. What's he doing there? He's undergoing an \"erasure\" procedure, after which he'll be given a new identity, a new name, and a new life, after which he'll be impossible to find. \nOur job is to prevent his permanent disappearance and punish him for all the wrongs he has done.",

Dozens of murdered and repressed civilians and freedom fighters, hours of torture and kilograms of files with dirt on innocent people - that's what the \"model agent\" went through. However, in an instant everything collapsed. October 3, 1990 marked a new era in Yosef's life, as well as in the lives of millions of other Germans. The end of the communist regime in Germany. Lindberg was able to find a way out of the situation, and did not lose his job - he fled to the United States to work directly for Uncle Sam, carrying out the orders of the United States government.\n\nHe spent more than 20 years from assignment to assignment, being on the battlefields of all major U.S. military conflicts of the time, operating behind enemy lines - he was a saboteur in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, pretending to be a UN journalist, playing an important role in helping U.S. liberation forces uncover enemy positions in the Persian Gulf, participating in Operation \"Democracy Uphold\", which was an intervention in Haiti to overthrow a dictatorship, coordinated U.S. bombings during Operation \"Allied Force\" in Yugoslavia, helped the CIA support local anti-government revolutionary militias during the wars in Pakistan, Iraq and Afghanistan, and after the failed Afghan invasion fleed undercover to Syria, later satying there to work in a mission, which consisted of disrupting ISIS, al-Qaeda and al-Nusra Front, and in 2015 was transferred to Libya and spent months overseeing the operation against local Islamist militias with help of General Reza Zaydan's Marrokan regiment, until frightening details emerged - During the time he worked for the U.S. and participated in various military conflicts he violated hundreds of international laws - he killed hostages and unarmed people, used his official position for his own good, disclosed state secrets and even abused prisoners of war and refugees in every possible way.\n\nAfter the disclosure of such compromising information, the CIA could not help but react - he was soon put on an international wanted list on charges including the disclosure of state secrets, various war crimes and abuse. \nYosef was able to react quickly and went on the run, starting to sell all information he knew - this is what has ruined his plan. Our employer, one of Berlin's largest and most influential radio agencies, is in danger - because Yosef has a lot of compromising data on them; it turns out that the agency was selling information about its listeners to the Stasi and, in fact, conducting illegal surveillance of them, which eventually led to thousands of arrests and repressions. This information must never be released to the public - and we will take care of it. \n\nAccording to our sources, after nearly a decade on the run, Lindbergh recently arrived on Harbor Island, where he is now staying as a VIP. What's he doing there? He's undergoing an \"erasure\" procedure, after which he'll be given a new identity, a new name, and a new life, after which he'll be impossible to find. \nOur job is to prevent his permanent disappearance and punish him for all the wrongs he has done.",

			"UI_CONTRACT_ESPRESSO_DESC": "Hello, 47. Today, you will be heading back to Haven Island for another mission. Your target is Yosef Lindbergh, a former Stasi agent who defected to the CIA and was secretly leaking data directly from Berlin to Washington. From the 1980s, he worked for the main secret federal agency of East Germany, the Stasi, but he also had a secret deal with the CIA, leaking communist government secrets to the USA. At the same time, he participated in the terrifying acts of the German militia, including torture, repression and mass murder. After the collapse of the communist regime in Germany, he fled to America, where he worked for the CIA and took part in secret operations in Kuwait, Yugoslavia, Haiti and elsewhere. He worked undercover for the American government until some data was leaked. Yosef regularly abused his authority, committing acts of unnecessary and unauthorised violence and using U.S. government secrets for his own benefit. He soon disappeared, but our client, a German radio agency, which Yosef has some compromising data about, and is afraid that their secrets could be leaked, saw an opportunity in his escape. We must hurry, as the target is currently undergoing a 'vanishing' procedure on Haven Island and will soon disappear again, possibly forever.\nGood luck, 47. I will leave you to prepare",

			"bio_actor_yosef_lindberch": "Yosef Lindberg was born on March 18, 1959, in a small town of five thousand people called Burg-Stàrrgard, in Mecklenburg, GDR. His father was an ethnic Jew, who although had a German surname (like many Jews living in Germany) worked in the city administration, and his mother, a German, was a housewife.\n\nDespite Yosef's respect for his father, they quarreled regularly for political reasons - the father was an orthodox socialist; he believed in the idea of collective property and communist ideals, and the young man had been drawn to the West since childhood - he was attracted to democratic values and American culture. During one of these quarrels, Yosef had to leave home - or rather, he was kicked out by his own father.\nHowever, despite his parents' expectations, the boy did not try to return - he earned enough money to hitchhike to Berlin and settle down in a local hotel.\n\nSoon he began to regularly attend meetings of the local enemies of the communist regime - the local Youth Democratic League, a youth organization that clandestinely united minds equally eager for freedom in their homeland. For several years, he studied English hard, and also went to the shooting range, learning to shoot and learning the basics of finance while moonlighting as a mechanic. After a few years, when he was in his early 20s, he decided to take a risk - to apply to the Stasi - and he was accepted. Now he was an agent of the GDR secret police, the hound dog of the communist regime.\n\nAfter working this way for a few months, he used his authority to secretly contact the CIA, making a deal and becoming a double agent. From that point on, he passed all the data he could find out about the East German government straight to hostile Washington. In an attempt to move up the ranks at the Stasi, to become a more respected employee, and to get more opportunities to snitch to the Americans, he turned in everyone he knew - even the very Youth Democratic League with which he had started. The poor people were arrested, and most likely repressed. In any case, no one ever saw them after their arrest.\n\nOver the next 10 years, Yosef became a very important Stasi operative - and practically the main CIA cell inside the GDR - but this career path did not come easily; Lindberg had to go over skulls.

			"UI_CONTRACT_ESPRESSO_DESC": "Здравствуй, 47. Сегодня ты вновь отправишься на остров \"Гавань\" для выполнения очередного задания. Твоя цель - Йозеф Линдберг, бывший агент Штази, перешедший на сторону ЦРУ и тайно сливавший данные прямо из Берлина в Вашингтон. С 1980-х годов он работал на главное правительственное секретное агентство  Восточной Германии - Штази,  при этом заключив тайную сделку с ЦРУ, сливая США секреты коммунистического правительства. В то же время он участвовал в ужасающих деяниях немецкой тайной милиции, включая пытки, репрессии и массовые убийства. После краха коммунистического режима в Германии он бежал в Америку, где работал на ЦРУ и принимал участие в секретных операциях в Кувейте, Югославии, на Гаити и в других странах. Он работал на американское правительство под прикрытием, пока не произошла утечка некоторых данных. Как вскрылось, Йозеф регулярно злоупотреблял своими полномочиями, совершая ненужные и несанкционированные акты насилия и используя правительственные секреты США в своих интересах. Вскоре он исчез, но наш клиент, немецкое радиоагентство, о котором у Йосефа есть компрометирующие данные и которое боится утечки своих секретов, увидело в его побеге благоприятную возможность. Мы должны поторопиться, так как цель в настоящее время проходит процедуру \"стирания\" на острове \"Гавань\" и вскоре снова исчезнет, возможно, навсегда.",
			"UI_CONTRACT_ESPRESSO_TITLE": "Hitman: Summer Special",
			"bio_actor_yosef_lindberch": "Йозеф Линдберг родился 18 марта 1959-го года, в небольшом городке с населением в пять тысяч человек под названием Бург-Шта́ргард, в Мекленбурге, ГДР. Его отец был этническим евреем, хоть и носил немецкую фамилию (как и многие евреи, проживающие в Германии), работал в городской администрации, а мать, немка, была домохозяйкой.\n\nНесмотря на уважение к отцу, они регулярно ссорились по политическим причинам - папа Йозефа был ортодоксальным социалистом; Верил в идею коллективной собственности и коммунистические идеалы, а юноша с детства тянулся к западу - его привлекали демократические ценности и американская культура. Во время одной из таких ссор Йозефу пришлось уйти из дома - точнее, его выгнал собственный отец. Однако, несмотря на ожидания родителей, парень не стал пытаться вернуться - он заработал достаточный капитал, чтоб попуткой добраться до Берлина и осесть в местном отеле.\n\nВскоре он начал регулярно посещать собрания местных врагов коммунистического режима - местную Юношескую Демократическую Лигу, молодёжную организацию, которая подпольно объединяло умы, одинаково стремящиеся к свободе на родине. Несколько лет он упорно изучал английский, а также ходил в тир, учусь стрелять и изучал основы финансов, при этом подрабатывая механиком. Через несколько лет, когда ему было около 20-ти, он решил рискнуть - податься в Штази - и его приняли. Теперь он был хоть и не особо почётным, но агентом тайной полиции ГДР, гончим псом коммунистического режима.\n\nПроработав так несколько месяцев, он, пользуясь своими полномочиями, смог тайно выйти на связь с ЦРУ, заключив сделку и став двойным агентом. С того момента он передавал все данные о правительстве Восточной Германии, которые мог узнать, прямиком во враждебный Вашингтон. В попытке подняться по карьерной лестнице в Штази, чтоб стать более уважаемым служащим, и получить больше возможностей настучать американцам, он сдал всех, кого знал - даже ту самую Юношескую Демократическую Лигу, с которой он и начал свой путь. Бедняг арестовали, и скорее всего, репрессировали. В любом случае, их после ареста никто не видел. \n\nЗа следующие 10 лет Йозеф стал очень важным оперативником Штази - и практически основной ячейкой ЦРУ внутри ГДР, но этот путь по карьерной лестнице не дался легко; Линдбергу пришлось идти по черепам. Десятки убитых и репрессированных мирных жителей и борцов за свободу, часы пыток и килограммы папок с компроматом на невинных людей - вот через что прошел \"образцовый агент\". Однако в один момент всё рухнуло. 3 октября 1990 года ознаменовал новую эпоху в жизни Йозефа, как и в жизни миллионов других немцев. Конец коммунистического режима в Германии. Линдберг смог найти выход из ситуации, и не лишился своей работы - он сбежал в США, чтоб работать непосредственно на дядюшку Сэма, выполняя поручения правительства Соединённых Штатов. \n\nБолее 20 лет он провёл от поручения к поручению, побывав на полях боя во всех основных военных конфликтах США того времени, действуя в тылу врага - он был диверсантом в оккупированном Ираком Кувейте, притворяясь журналистом ООН, играя важную роль, помогая американским освободительным войскам раскрыть позиции врага в Персидском Заливе, участвовал в операции \"Поддержка Демократии\", что заключалась в интервенции на Гаити с целью свержения диктатуры, координировал бомбардировки США во время операции \"Союзная Сила\" в Югославии, помогал ЦРУ поддерживать местных ополченцев во время войн в Пакистане, Ираке и Афганистане, после провала вторжения в Афганистан действовал под прикрытием в Сирии, подрывая деятельность ИГИЛ, \"Аль-Каиды\" и \"Фронт ан-Нусра\", а в 2015 переведён в Ливию, и несколько месяцев курировал операцию по противостоянию местным исламистам при поддержке интервентов марроканского полка генерала Резы Зейдана, пока не вскрылись пугающие подробности - несколько военных журналистов ООН, тайно ведящих наблюдение за Йозефом уже более 10 лет, раскрыли, всё что смогли добыть о нём - за то время, пока он работал на США, и участвовал в различных военных конфликтах он нарушил сотни международных законов - убивал заложников и безоружных, пользовался служебным положением, разглашал государственные тайны и даже всячески издевался над военнопленными и беженцами.\n\nПосле разглашения такой компрометирующей информации ЦРУ не могло не отреагировать - вскоре не был объявлен в международный розыск по обвинениям в том числе в разглашении государственных тайн, различных военных преступлениях и даже надругательствах. \nЙозеф смог среагировать быстро и пустился в бега, начав торговать известной ему информацией - это его в погубило. Наш наниматель, одно из самых больших и влиятельных берлинских радиоагентств находится в опасности - ведь у Йозефа есть на них очень много компрометирующих данных; Оказывается, агенство продавало Штази информацию о своих слушателях и, по сути, вело незаконную слежу за ними, что в итоге привело с тысячам арестованных и репрессированных. Эта информация ни в коем случае не должны выйти в свет - и мы об этом позаботимся.\n\nПо нашим данным, после почти десяти лет в бегах, Линдберг недавно прибыл на остров \"Гавань\", где сейчас находится как ВИП-клиент. Что он там делает? Проходит процедуру \"стирания\", после которой он получит новую личность, имя, и начнёт жить новой жизнью, после чего найти его будет невозможно. \nНаше же дело - предотвратить его перманентную пропажу и наказать за все совершенные злодеяния.",

			"bio_actor_yosef_lindberch": "约瑟夫·林德伯格于1959年3月18日出生在东德梅克伦堡州一个名为布尔格-施塔尔加德的小镇，该镇人口仅有五千人。他的父亲是犹太人，尽管拥有德国姓氏（与许多居住在德国的犹太人一样），但他在市政厅工作，而他的母亲是德国人，是一名家庭主妇。\n\n尽管约瑟夫尊重他的父亲，但他们经常因政治原因发生争吵——父亲是一位正统的社会主义者，他相信集体所有制和共产主义理想，而这位年轻人自幼便被西方吸引——他被民主价值观和美国文化所吸引。在一次争吵中，约瑟夫不得不离开家——或者说，他被自己的父亲赶了出去。\n\n然而，尽管父母期望他回来，这个男孩并没有试图返回——他赚够了钱搭便车去柏林，并在当地一家酒店安顿下来。\n\n不久，他开始定期参加当地反共产主义政权的会议——当地的青年民主联盟，一个秘密团结了同样渴望在祖国获得自由的年轻人的组织。几年间，他刻苦学习英语，还去射击场练习射击，同时兼职做机械师，学习财务基础知识。几年后，当他二十出头时，他决定冒险一把——申请加入斯塔西——并被录取。现在，他成了东德秘密警察的间谍，共产主义政权的走狗。\n\n在这样工作了几个月后，他利用自己的职权秘密联系了中情局，达成协议并成为双重间谍。从那时起，他将能获取的关于东德政府的所有情报直接传递给敌对的华盛顿。为了在斯塔西内部晋升、成为更受尊重的员工并获得更多向美国人告密的机会，他举报了所有认识的人——甚至包括他最初加入的青年民主联盟。这些可怜的人被逮捕，很可能遭到镇压。无论如何，他们被捕后再也没有人见过他们。\n\n在接下来的10年里，约瑟夫成为一名非常重要的斯塔西特工——几乎是东德境内中央情报局的主要联络点——但这条职业道路并不容易；林德伯格不得不跨越重重障碍。数十名被谋杀和镇压的平民和自由战士，数小时的酷刑，以及数公斤关于无辜者的污点文件——这就是“模范特工”所经历的。然而，一切在瞬间崩溃。1990年10月3日，约瑟夫的生活以及数百万德国人的生活都迎来了新纪元——德国共产主义政权的终结。林德伯格设法摆脱了困境，并未失去工作——他逃往美国，直接为“山姆大叔”效力，执行美国政府的命令。\n\n他花了超过20年时间，从一个任务到另一个任务，出现在当时美国所有主要军事冲突的战场上，在敌后活动——他是伊拉克占领的科威特的一名破坏者，假扮联合国记者，在帮助美国解放力量揭露波斯湾敌军阵地，参与“民主维护行动”，该行动是干预海地以推翻独裁政权，协调“盟军行动”期间对南斯拉夫的空袭，协助中情局支持巴基斯坦、伊拉克和阿富汗战争中的反政府革命民兵，并在阿富汗入侵失败后秘密逃往叙利亚，随后留在那里执行一项任务，该任务旨在破坏伊斯兰国、基地组织和努斯拉阵线，2015年被调往利比亚，在雷扎·泽丹将军的摩洛哥军团协助下，监督针对当地伊斯兰主义民兵组织的行动，直到令人震惊的细节浮出水面——在他为美国工作期间 并参与各种军事冲突期间，他违反了数百项国际法——他杀害人质和无武装人员，利用官方职位谋取私利，泄露国家机密，甚至以各种方式虐待战俘和难民。\n\n在这些敏感信息曝光后，中情局不得不采取行动——他很快被列入国际通缉名单，罪名包括泄露国家机密、各种战争罪行和虐待。\n\n约瑟夫迅速反应并开始逃亡，开始出售他所掌握的所有信息——这正是毁了他计划的原因。我们的雇主，柏林最大、最有影响力的广播机构之一，正面临危险——因为约瑟夫掌握了大量对其不利的数据；原来该机构一直在向斯塔西出售听众信息，并实际上对听众进行非法监视，这最终导致了数千人的逮捕和镇压。此信息绝不能向公众披露——我们将妥善处理。 \n\n据我们的消息来源透露，在逃亡近十年后，林德伯格最近抵达了哈伯岛，目前正以VIP身份在此居住。他正在那里接受一项“清除”程序，之后将获得新的身份、新的姓名和新的生活，届时他将彻底消失，无法被找到。 \n\n我们的任务是阻止他永久消失，并惩罚他所犯下的所有罪行。",

			"UI_CONTRACT_ESPRESSO_DESC": "Hello, 47. Today, you will be heading back to Haven Island for another mission. Your target is Yosef Lindbergh, a former Stasi agent who defected to the CIA and was secretly leaking data directly from Berlin to Washington. From the 1980s, he worked for the main secret federal agency of East Germany, the Stasi, but he also had a secret deal with the CIA, leaking communist government secrets to the USA. At the same time, he participated in the terrifying acts of the German militia, including torture, repression and mass murder. After the collapse of the communist regime in Germany, he fled to America, where he worked for the CIA and took part in secret operations in Kuwait, Yugoslavia, Haiti and elsewhere. He worked undercover for the American government until some data was leaked. Yosef regularly abused his authority, committing acts of unnecessary and unauthorised violence and using U.S. government secrets for his own benefit. He soon disappeared, but our client, a German radio agency, which Yosef has some compromising data about, and is afraid that their secrets could be leaked, saw an opportunity in his escape. We must hurry, as the target is currently undergoing a 'vanishing' procedure on Haven Island and will soon disappear again, possibly forever.\nGood luck, 47. I will leave you to prepare",

			"bio_actor_yosef_lindberch": "Yosef Lindberg was born on March 18, 1959, in a small town of five thousand people called Burg-Stàrrgard, in Mecklenburg, GDR. His father was an ethnic Jew, who although had a German surname (like many Jews living in Germany) worked in the city administration, and his mother, a German, was a housewife.\n\nDespite Yosef's respect for his father, they quarreled regularly for political reasons - the father was an orthodox socialist; he believed in the idea of collective property and communist ideals, and the young man had been drawn to the West since childhood - he was attracted to democratic values and American culture. During one of these quarrels, Yosef had to leave home - or rather, he was kicked out by his own father.\nHowever, despite his parents' expectations, the boy did not try to return - he earned enough money to hitchhike to Berlin and settle down in a local hotel.\n\nSoon he began to regularly attend meetings of the local enemies of the communist regime - the local Youth Democratic League, a youth organization that clandestinely united minds equally eager for freedom in their homeland. For several years, he studied English hard, and also went to the shooting range, learning to shoot and learning the basics of finance while moonlighting as a mechanic. After a few years, when he was in his early 20s, he decided to take a risk - to apply to the Stasi - and he was accepted. Now he was an agent of the GDR secret police, the hound dog of the communist regime.\n\nAfter working this way for a few months, he used his authority to secretly contact the CIA, making a deal and becoming a double agent. From that point on, he passed all the data he could find out about the East German government straight to hostile Washington. In an attempt to move up the ranks at the Stasi, to become a more respected employee, and to get more opportunities to snitch to the Americans, he turned in everyone he knew - even the very Youth Democratic League with which he had started. The poor people were arrested, and most likely repressed. In any case, no one ever saw them after their arrest.\n\nOver the next 10 years, Yosef became a very important Stasi operative - and practically the main CIA cell inside the GDR - but this career path did not come easily; Lindberg had to go over skulls. Dozens of murdered and repressed civilians and freedom fighters, hours of torture and kilograms of files with dirt on innocent people - that's what the \"model agent\" went through. However, in an instant everything collapsed. October 3, 1990 marked a new era in Yosef's life, as well as in the lives of millions of other Germans. The end of the communist regime in Germany. Lindberg was able to find a way out of the situation, and did not lose his job - he fled to the United States to work directly for Uncle Sam, carrying out the orders of the United States government.\n\nHe spent more than 20 years from assignment to assignment, being on the battlefields of all major U.S. military conflicts of the time, operating behind enemy lines - he was a saboteur in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, pretending to be a UN journalist, playing an important role in helping U.S. liberation forces uncover enemy positions in the Persian Gulf, participating in Operation \"Democracy Uphold\", which was an intervention in Haiti to overthrow a dictatorship, coordinated U.S. bombings during Operation \"Allied Force\" in Yugoslavia, helped the CIA support local anti-government revolutionary militias during the wars in Pakistan, Iraq and Afghanistan, and after the failed Afghan invasion fleed undercover to Syria, later satying there to work in a mission, which consisted of disrupting ISIS, al-Qaeda and al-Nusra Front, and in 2015 was transferred to Libya and spent months overseeing the operation against local Islamist militias with help of General Reza Zaydan's Marrokan regiment, until frightening details emerged - During the time he worked for the U.S. and participated in various military conflicts he violated hundreds of international laws - he killed hostages and unarmed people, used his official position for his own good, disclosed state secrets and even abused prisoners of war and refugees in every possible way.\n\nAfter the disclosure of such compromising information, the CIA could not help but react - he was soon put on an international wanted list on charges including the disclosure of state secrets, various war crimes and abuse. \nYosef was able to react quickly and went on the run, starting to sell all information he knew - this is what has ruined his plan. Our employer, one of Berlin's largest and most influential radio agencies, is in danger - because Yosef has a lot of compromising data on them; it turns out that the agency was selling information about its listeners to the Stasi and, in fact, conducting illegal surveillance of them, which eventually led to thousands of arrests and repressions. This information must never be released to the public - and we will take care of it. \n\nAccording to our sources, after nearly a decade on the run, Lindbergh recently arrived on Harbor Island, where he is now staying as a VIP. What's he doing there? He's undergoing an \"erasure\" procedure, after which he'll be given a new identity, a new name, and a new life, after which he'll be impossible to find. \nOur job is to prevent his permanent disappearance and punish him for all the wrongs he has done.",
